# Minishell
The objective of this project is for you to create a simple shell. 

## Core Features (The Main Components):

Input Parsing:  
   - Handle user input and parse commands.
   - Tokenize the input (split into commands, arguments, and operators).
   - Handle spaces and special characters like quotes, redirections, etc.

Execution:
   - Execute the command by forking processes.
   - Handle built-in commands like echo, cd, pwd, exit.
   - Handle external commands by searching for executables in directories listed in $PATH.

Redirection:
   - Implement input and output redirections (<, >, >>).
   - Handle file descriptors (STDOUT, STDIN, STDERR).
   - Handle append mode with >>.

Pipes:
   - Implement piping (|) between commands (e.g., command1 | command2).
   - Handle multiple pipes in a single command (e.g., command1 | command2 | command3).

Built-in Commands:
   - Implement built-in commands like cd, exit, echo, pwd.
   - Handle their functionalities and edge cases.

Signals:
   - Handle signals like SIGINT (Ctrl+C) and SIGQUIT (Ctrl+).
   - Implement custom signal handling for foreground and background processes.

Environment Variables:
   - Implement access to environment variables (like $HOME, $PATH).
   -  Handle export, unset, and env commands.

Error Handling:
   - Implement error messages for invalid commands and arguments.
   - Handle memory allocation errors or process failures.

Bonus Features (if applicable for 42 project):

    Job Control:
        Implement background jobs with &.
        Implement fg, bg, and jobs built-in commands.
    History:
        Implement a history mechanism for recalling previous commands.
    Tab Completion:
        Implement basic tab completion for commands or file paths.

## Git Workflow for the Project

### Branching Strategy:

   You can follow a simple Git branching model to ensure smooth collaboration between two people.

   - Main branch (main): This is the stable version of your project. Only merge into main when everything works and is tested.

   - Feature branches: For each new task, create a separate branch. This allows you to work on different features simultaneously without interfering with each otherâ€™s code.  
        Example: feature/input-parsing, feature/redirection, feature/pipes, feature/builtins.

   - Merge requests: When one of you finishes a task on a feature branch, create a Pull Request (PR) to merge into the main branch. The other team member should review the code and test it.

### Task Distribution Using Git:

   - Create a new branch for each task: Start a branch when you begin working on a task. Each task corresponds to a Git branch (e.g., feature/input-parsing or feature/redirection).

   - Commit frequently: Make small, frequent commits with meaningful commit messages, such as:
        Implemented input parsing for basic commands
        Fixed bug in redirection for stdin

   - Pull regularly: Pull the latest changes from the main branch to keep your local branch up to date.

### Example Git Workflow:

   - Create the repository and initialize the main branch.
   - Create feature branches for different tasks.
   - Commit your work frequently with clear commit messages.
   - Push changes to the remote repository.
   - Open pull requests (PR) and have the other teammate review the changes before merging into the main branch.
   - Merge and test the code in the main branch when both features are working.
